This is an android based application that uses ‘firebase
authentication’ and the details of user are stored in ‘firebase realtime
database’. It enables the user to undertake a series of questions. At the end of
the quiz, a result-report is generated which states the score. The app also
presents an option to the current user to play the question-round again or quit
in between.
